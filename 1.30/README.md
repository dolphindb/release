* Increased the CPU bound limit from 32 cores to 64 cores on Windows. (**1.30.3**)

* When calling the function `addMetrics` to add metrics to the time series engine dynamically, an exception will be thrown if parameter *windowSize* differs from the original specification. (**1.30.3**)

* The parameter *filter* of function `subscribeTable` supports hash filter and range filter in addition to value filter. (**1.30.3**)

* The aggregate functions specified by parameter *aggs* of `window join` support returning multiple values. (**1.30.2**)

* String concatenated by function *concat* will be automatically converted to BLOB if the length is over 65535 bytes or it contains ASCII 0 (NULL). (**1.30.2**)

* The aggregate functions specified by parameter *metrics* of the time series engine support returning multiple values. Metrics with aliases such as `avg(price) as price` are also supported. (**1.30.2**)

* Added an optional parameter *timeTrigger* to function `subscribeTable` for time-triggered message processing. (**1.30.1**)

* STRING longer than 65535 bytes will be automatically converted to BLOB during serialization. (**1.30.1**)
